                        <li>Cohen was a little different. He wasn’t particularly fantastic at math, he didn’t study global economies, he had no unique investing philosophy. He was just a great trader,</li>
                    
                        <li>The key to making money, they believed, was by intelligently controlling their losses</li>
                    
                        <li>An agent met Ali Far in the lobby and escorted him to a conference room on the sixth floor; after making sure the elevator was clear, Andrew Michaelson met Far’s partner, C. B. Lee, and brought him to the fifth floor. Michaelson and another prosecutor, Josh Klein, raced back and forth between the two rooms, trying to act as if nothing unusual was going on. The goal was to play them off against one another and try to pressure them to cooperate fully, all without alienating them. It was a delicate situation.</li>
                    
                        <li>Mathew’s performance wasn’t enough to get him into Harvard, and his father was furious at his son. His anger drove him to a stunning act of paternal cruelty. A few weeks after Mathew’s eighteenth birthday, he presented his son with a plaque that said: “Son Who Shattered His Father’s Dream.”</li>
                    
                        <li>The financial industry has evolved to be so complex that large parts of it are almost completely beyond the reach of regulators and law enforcement</li>
                    
                        <li>it has become almost impossible, due to a lack of will</li>

                        <li>And like a crapshooter who has a pretty lady to blow on his dice, the speculators in both countries had an amazing array of irrational systems to help them win money. They had to guess which direction the American bond market would take: up or down. The systems usually involved staring for hours at charts showing the history of bond prices. As in Rorschach ink blots, an unlikely formation, such as a human head and shoulders, made itself privately known to the viewer. The chartist—for that is what such a person called himself—would then use his ruler and pencil to draw the future of bond prices based on the assumption that the historical pattern could be projected forward. Miraculously, in a bull market, the resulting forecast was usually that the market was going up.</li>
                    
                        <li>The trainee had tried to impress the trader and failed. The trader had said, “You are proof that some people are born to be customers.</li>
                    
                        <li>Investors do not fear losing money as much as they fear solitude, by which I mean taking risks that others avoid.</li>
                    
                        <li>The second pattern to Alexander’s thought was that in the event of a major dislocation, such as a stock market crash, a natural disaster, the breakdown of OPEC’s production agreements, he would look away from the initial focus of investor interest and seek secondary and tertiary effects.</li>
                    
                        <li>I spent much of my working life inventing logical lies like this. Most of the time when markets move, no one has any idea why. A man who can tell a good story can make a good living as a broker. It was the job of people like me to make up reasons, to spin a plausible yarn</li>
                    
                        <li>What would a painter do if a rival stole his work and put his name on it? He’d paint a replica and issue a challenge for the rival to do the same</li>
                    
                        <li>In short, junk bonds behave much more like equity, or shares, than old-fashioned corporate bonds</li>
                    
                        <li>A take-over of a large corporation could generate billions of dollars’ worth of junk bonds, for not only would new junk be issued, but the increased leverage transformed the outstanding bonds of a former blue-chip corporation to junk.</li>
                    
                        <li>“Every company has got people sitting around who do nothing for what they get paid,” says Joe Perella. “If they take on a lot of debt, it forces them to cut fat.” The take-over specialists did for debt what Ivan Boesky did for greed. Debt is good, they said. Debt works.</li>
